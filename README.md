# Random-Forest-Implementation
Random forest implementation for classification in R.

## Project structure 
* `src/DecisionTree.R` contains the code for the classification decision tree
* `src/RandomForest.R` contains the code for the random forest algorithm, performs the training in parallel using the `parallel` library
* `examples/*` contrains implementation examples
